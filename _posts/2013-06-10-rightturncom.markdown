Right Turn

[rightturn.com]: http://rightturn.com

RightTurn.com is a website for consumers to order tires and schedule an appointment to have them installed at a local dealer. This was a mid-development team. My work was taking psd design documents and developing the html/css/javascript. 

We used:

 - jQuery
 - Backbone.js
 - Underscore.js
