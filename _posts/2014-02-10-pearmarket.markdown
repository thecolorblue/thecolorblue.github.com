Pear Market is an online marketplace where customers can buy food directly from farmers. Farmers have control over their own products, when they are available, and where the can be picked up. Customers can browse local products, see exactly which item they are buying, and then place an order that will be available at the farms pickup location. Farmers can use the site to communicate with current customers gain new customers by opening them up to a much larger audience.
