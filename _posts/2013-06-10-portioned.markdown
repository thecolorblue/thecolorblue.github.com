Portioned

[getportioned.com]: http://getportioned.com

Portioned was a project from the 2013 Cleveland Startup Bus heading to SXSW. It was a web application that allows users to search for a recipe, and order the ingredients at a local grocery store. The app searches for recipes on yummly.com, pulls out the ingredient information and creates a shopping list from that. The user can also edit the shopping list, both the servings of each recipe and the total ingredients they want. 

We used:
 - jQuery
 - Backbone.js
 - Underscore.js
 - Express.js
 - Murray CMS
