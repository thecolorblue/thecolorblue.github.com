Here are all the css files that the html is linking too.

	glyphs
	icons for the UI
JS
these are all the javascript files. Most of them are not actually in use, but I am keeping them here so the can be quickly used if we add in some code that needs jquery or mootools.

Files
This folder has been cleaned up to only include the html files that are a part of them theme. Everything else has been backed up and stored in another folder not on dropbox. All html files should work in your browser siting on you local computer. There are some issues with the facebox javascript in Chrome browser but only when the html files are not on a web server, so we will not run into the problem when the site goes live.
